    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p id="write-up">
      Holy Family Youth Village in Amansea, Awka, is more than just student housing - it's a transformatice community built to support young people academically, spiritually, and socially. founded by <strong>Archbishop Valerian Okeke</strong> of the Catholic Archdiocese of Onitsha, the Youth Village was born from a clear recognition: students deserve dignified, safe, and supportive environments that fuel their ambitions and character, not just shelter. <br><br>

      Designed with modern student needs in mind, the Village offers well-equipped hostel buildings with comfortable rooms, study spaces, power and water infrastructure, and facilities for sports, leisure, and social life. From reliable electricity and clean water to communal spaces, this is a place where learning extends beyond the classroom. <br><br>

      Living here isn't about accommodation - it's about growth, respect, and community, residents benefit from structured living that encourages academic excellence, leadership development, and life skills. Over the years, the village has nurtured hundreds of students who excele not just in grades, but in leadership roles, enterpreneurial ventures, and personal development. <br><br>

      Located just minutes from Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Holy Family Youth Village combines convenince, safety, and opportunity - making it a preferred choice for students who want more than a place to sleep. It's a launchpad for future leaders, grounded in values and built for success.
